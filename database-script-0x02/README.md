## Explanation of the Sample Data:

User: Includes a mix of guests and hosts with different contact information and registration dates. Passwords are included as placeholders (in a real application, these would be securely hashed).
Property: Features different types of properties (apartment, house) in various locations, owned by different hosts, with varying prices and capacities.
Booking: Shows multiple bookings made by different guests for different properties, with varying check-in/out dates, prices, and booking statuses. One booking is left as 'Pending' to illustrate that state.
Review: Contains reviews left by guests for their completed bookings, including ratings and comments. Each review is linked to a specific booking, guest, and property.
Payment: Details the payments made for confirmed bookings, including the amount, payment date, status, and method. Payments are linked to their corresponding bookings.
